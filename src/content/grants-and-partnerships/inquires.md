*Note: While MFF currently supports other environmental causes, we have transitioned our focus primarily to the areas listed above. MFF has existing and continuing obligations to higher education and art education. There are no plans to expand these. All funding is solely at the discretion of the McKinney Family Foundation Board of Directors.*
