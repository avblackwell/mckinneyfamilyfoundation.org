## Sustainable Energy Economy Framework

MFF is resolute in our efforts to expand a sustainable clean energy economy through renewable energy jobs creation and meaningful policy change.

We partner with Indiana-based private, public, and nonprofit organizations that develop and implement programs to reach sustainability goals.

MFF’s work helps build the framework to support a clean energy economy. Strategies include active partnerships with the Indiana Energy Independence Fund and Advanced Energy United.
