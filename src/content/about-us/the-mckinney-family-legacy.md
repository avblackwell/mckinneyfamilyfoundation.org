## The McKinney Family Legacy

The McKinney Family Foundation (MFF) is a multi-generation family foundation established in 2010 by Robert H. McKinney and his five children – Kent A. McKinney, Kevin K. McKinney, Lisa C. McKinney, Marni McKinney Waterfield, and Robert C. McKinney.

In addition to MFF’s focus areas, Mr. McKinney’s personal philanthropy supports postsecondary and legal education and scholarship, and numerous community-based and civic organizations.

The Foundation’s early work primarily focused on conservation, higher education and the art. Today, MFF strives to be the foremost catalyst for climate change solutions, environmental progress, and leadership in Indiana.
